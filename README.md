**WORK IN PROGRESS**

# Hogwash

A programming language that compiles to bash, with rust-like syntax,
gradual static typing and immutability by default.

This is a toy project made as an exercise in compiler construction and to try
out ANTLR4.
Most idioms are implemented from Terence Parr `Language Implementation Patterns`
and `The Definitive ANTLR4 Reference` books.

### Status

Not usable yet. Will work on it as a weekend side project.
