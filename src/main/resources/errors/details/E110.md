# E110: Variable already exists as function

This error occurs when you try to define a variable with the same name as a 
function defined in the unit:

```
fn foo() {
	// ...
}

let foo = 1; // error: foo is already defined as a function
```

In Hogwash, you can't have both a variable and a function associated with the 
same identifier. The compiler prevents accidental overriding by raising an 
**E110**.
