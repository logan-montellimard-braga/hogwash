# E104: Variable is never used

This error occurs when you define a variable, but never references it anywhere.
Note that usage checks are only done on private variable, which is the default 
visibility. Public variables are variables that can be exported beyond the 
module they were defined in and as such, the dead code finder assumes they may 
be referenced by another module or program.

For example,

```
let x = 1;
let y = 2;
let pub z = 3;

echo(y);
```

variable `x` is private and never used, so it will raise an **E104**, while 
variable `z` is never used  but is public, so it won't.

Note that **E104** is typically raised as a warning to help you clean your code,
and not a fatal error.
