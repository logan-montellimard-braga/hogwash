# E105: Variable is never set

This error occurs when you define *and use* a variable, but never assign to it.
For example,

```
let mut x;
echo(x) // x is never set
```

This detection is nonetheless very limited; since variable setting can occur
anywhere in the global scope or in a function, the Hogwash compiler doesn't 
track the order in which you can assign and use a variable. This means that if 
you set a variable in a function that is never called, no warnings will be 
raised: 

```
let mut x;

fn foo() {
	x = 0;
}

// foo() is never called
```

This behavior should be fixed in future releases.


Note that if you don't set the variable but don't use it either, only an **E104** 
will be raised.

Note that **E105** is typically raised as a warning and not a fatal error.
