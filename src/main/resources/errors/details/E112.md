# E112: Mutable variable is all uppercase

This error occurs when you define a mutable variable with an all uppercase name.
By convention, although all constants are not necessarily all uppercase, every 
all uppercase identifier should be a constant. Hogwash tries to help you enforce
such convention:

```
let ABC = 1; // ok, constant in uppercase
let abc = 1; // ok, constants can be lowercase too
let mut XYZ = 1; // error, all-uppercase identifiers should be constants
```

Note that this is typically raised as a warning and not a fatal error.
