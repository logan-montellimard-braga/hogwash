# E900: Looping statement used out of a loop

This error occurs when you try to use a loop-only statement while not in a 
looping construct:

```
fn foo() {
	continue; // error: not in a loop
}

loop {
	break; // ok
}
```

Loop-only statements include:
+ `break`
+ `continue`


Looping structures include:
+ `loop { }`
+ `while (...) { }`
+ `do { } while (...)`
+ `for (...) { }`
