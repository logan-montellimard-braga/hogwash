# E100: Variable does not exist

This error occurs when you try to use a variable that was not declared, whether 
in this scope or one of its parent scopes.

This error means no suitable declaration was found at all; if a declaration was 
found, but after the variable reference in the source file (forward reference),
an **E101** is raised instead.
