# E200: Function does not exist

This error occurs when you try to call a function that does not exist in the 
unit.

Functions in Hogwash are private (local to the module they are defined in) by 
default. If you want to use functions from imported modules, you must declare 
them as public:

```
pub fn foo() { ... }
```
