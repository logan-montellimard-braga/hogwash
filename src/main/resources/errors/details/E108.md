# E108: Immutable variable is assigned to

This error occurs when you try to change an immutable variable after its 
declaration:

```
let x = 1;
x++; // error: trying to change an immutable variable !
```

Declare the variable as mutable if you need to change its value later on:

```
let mut x = 1;
x++ // ok, x is mutable
```
