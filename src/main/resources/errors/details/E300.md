# E300: Module not found

This error occurs when you try to import a non-existent module.

In Hogwash, you require a module with the `import "module_name";` statement, 
which tries to find the corresponding hogwash file from the path of the compiled
module.

For example, il you have the following code structure:

```
+ src/
  | foo/
  | | bar/
  | | | bar.hogwash
  | | foo.hogwash
  | frob.hogwash
```

and considering that `frob.hogwash` is your root module, you can import 
`foo.hogwash` with `import "foo/foo"`. Inside `foo.hogwash`, you can import 
`bar.hogwash` with `import "bar/bar"`, but you would need `import "foo/bar/bar"`
to import it from the root module.

Absolute paths are allowed.
