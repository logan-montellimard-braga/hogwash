# E202: Function already exists

This error occurs when you try to declare a function with the same name as an 
already existing function.

All function names aren't available; Hogwash includes a set of shell builtin 
functions, like `echo` or `kill`. An **E202** will be raised if you try to 
define a function with the same name, although you didn't already define the 
first one yourself. In this case, you will see `<builtin>:0:0` in the error message 
indicating the original function definition.
