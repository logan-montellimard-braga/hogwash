# E001: Shell-specific builtins loading failed

This error indicates that the given shell builtin functions could not be
bootstrapped into the compiler, meaning they won't be available to the files to
compile.
For example, bash builtin `echo` won't be recognized and will raise an error if
the modules being compiled call it as a normal function (without the `@` prefix
indicating an externally-defined function).

This error may occur if an incorrect or unsupported shell name is given to the
compiler, or if the JAR archive is tampered with, since the list of shell
builtins is kept as a resource file in the JAR itself.
