# E107: Variable is immutable and not initialized

This error occurs when you declare a variable as immutable (the default
behavior) without initializing:

```
let x; // x is never initialized
```

This raises en error because since `x` is immutable, you can't assign to it 
later. You must initialize the binding right away.

If you need to use an immutable variable but can't initialize it at declaration,
you should split the procedure with a mutable binding:

```
let mut _x;
// setting _x with various procedures
// ...
let x = _x;
```
