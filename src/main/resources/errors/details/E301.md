# E301: Import is redundant

This error occurs when an already imported module is being imported. This 
typically happens when specifying circular dependencies between modules, for 
example module A imports module B which imports module A.

Since module imports are transitive and order-dependant, importing module C in 
module B, and importing module B in module A, means that module C is also 
visible in module A. This implies that manually importing module C in module A 
will result in an **E301** being raised.

Note that **E301** is typically raised as a warning and not a fatal error.
