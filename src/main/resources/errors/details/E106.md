# E106: Variable is public and mutable

This error occurs when you try to declare a variable as both public and mutable:

```
let pub mut x = 1;
```

This raises an error because in Hogwash, public (exportable) variables must be 
immutable in order to avoid state mutation between modules.

Try declaring the variable as immutable to fix the error:

```
let pub x = 1;
```

or encapsulate the mutation logic in public functions.
