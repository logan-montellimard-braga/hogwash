# E206: Function is already defined as a variable

This error occurs when you try to define a function with the same name as an 
already existing variable:

```
let foo = 1;

fn foo() { ... } // error: foo already exists
```

In Hogwash, variables and function can't share a name and you can't change the 
nature of the identifier (variable or function) in a redefinition.
