# E101: Forward reference

This error occurs when you try to use a variable before it is declared. It means
a proper declaration was found in this scope, but an error is still raised 
because forward references are not allowed in Hogwash for readability reasons.

```
echo(x); // error: x is used before its declaration

let x = 1;
```

If no proper declaration was found for a variable at all, an **E100** is raised
instead.
