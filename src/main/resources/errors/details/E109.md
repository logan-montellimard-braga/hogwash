# E109: External variable exists in the unit

This error occurs when you reference a variable as external with the `@` prefix,
but a variable of the same name was found in this module or its imports.
For example,

```
echo(@var); // var exists

let var = 1;
```

This error is raised even if the samely-named variable is declared later in the 
source file.
This may be an indication that you are using a mispelled variable, or that you 
are shadowing an external or environment variable.
