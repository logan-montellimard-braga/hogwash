# E207: Function is called with the wrong arity

This error occurs when you try to call a function with the wrong number of 
parameters:

```
fn foo(abc) { ... }

foo(1);    // ok
foo(1, 2); // wrong arity
foo();     // wrong arity
```

If the function defines default valued parameters, these parameters are 
optional, and the function has a min and max arity:

```
fn foo(abc, xyz = 1) { // foo can be called with 1 or 2 parameters

}

foo(1);    // ok
foo(1, 2); // ok
```
