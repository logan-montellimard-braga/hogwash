# E205: Function is never called

This error occurs when you declare a private (default behavior) function, but
never call it:

```
fn foo() {  }

echo(1);
```

If you declare the function as public with the `pub` modifier, the function will
be exported and available to modules importing this module, so the compiler 
assumes it will be used and doesn't raise en **E205**.

Note that this is typically raised as a warning to help you find dead code, and 
not a fatal error.
