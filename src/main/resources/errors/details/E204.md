# E204: External function exists in this unit

This error occurs when you try to call a function with the external prefix `@`, 
but a function with the same name is available in this module or its imports:

```
function foo() { ... }

@foo(); // error: foo is called as external but exists!
```

This error may be an indication that you are shadowing an external program name.

A frequent cause of this error is the use of shell builtin functions as 
external; in Hogwash, builtin functions are added to the compilation unit just 
like if you defined them yourself. You don't need to call them as external. Only
external, non-builtin programs can be called as external:

```
@echo(...); // error: echo is a builtin
@firefox(); // ok: firefox is an external program
```
