# E102: Variable already exists

This error occurs when you try to re-define a variable that already exists under
the same name.
For example,

```
let mut x = 1;
let mut x = 2;
```

redefines variable `x`. You might want to just *mutate* the variable's value 
instead:

```
let mut x = 1;
x = 2;
```

Note that this is typically raised as a warning intended to help you proofread
your code, and not a fatal error.
