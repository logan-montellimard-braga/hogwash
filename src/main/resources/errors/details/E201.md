# E201: Function is not a variable

This error occurs when you try to use a function as a variable, for example by 
passing it to another function:

```
fn foo() { ... }

echo(foo); // error: foo is a function!
```

Hogwash does not support first class nor higher order functions, so you can't 
pass them around like you would do with variables.
