# E111: Variable is declared with an unsafe name

This error occurs when you try to define a variable with a name that might be 
unsafe to use in your program, because it can potentially be overriden in the 
generated shell code.
Hogwash will add temporary and state-keeping variables when generating code, and
all of these variables will start with `__` followed by a non underscore 
character. Thus, variables starting similarly are at risk:

```
let __foo = 1; // __foo is unsafe
let ___bar = 0; // ___bar is ok, 3 underscores
```

Note that this is typically raised as a warning and not a fatal error.
